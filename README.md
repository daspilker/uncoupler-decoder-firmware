Uncoupler Decoder
=================

This repository contains the source code of the firmware for an decoder for the Märklin Digital system. The decoder has only one output and is well suited for uncoupler tracks.

The Atmel AVR Toolchain is needed for compiling and the AVR CommandLineTools for flashing.
